## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is just my learning experience and is not meant to be a complete guide to the world of three.
Just a few things I've learned about threejs.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS, npm, and the [threejs](https://threejs.org/) library.
For more information, see [the threejs documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html).

Execute this command after cloning the repository to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
